                            <strong>Paper 2 : The Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid.</strong>
                        </p>
                        According to the molecular-kinetic theory of heat, bodies of a microscopically visible size suspended in liquids must, 
                        as a result of thermal molecular motions, perform motions of such magnitude that they can be easily observed with a microscope. 
                        It is possible that the motions to be discussed here are identical with so-called Brownian molecular motion; 
                        however, the data available to me on the latter are so imprecise that I could not form a judgment on the question. 
                        If the motion to be discussed here can actually be observed, together with the laws it is expected to obey, 
                        then classical thermodynamics can no longer be viewed as applying to regions that can be distinguished even 
                        with a microscope, and an exact determination of actual atomic sizes becomes possible. On the other hand, if the prediction 
                        of this motion were to be proved wrong, this fact would provide a far-reaching argument against the molecular-kinetic 
                        conception of heat.

                    the deeply troubling subject of war. Published in 1933, Einstein's essay was a response to the ominous
                    political climate of the time, which included the rise of totalitarian regimes and the looming threat 
                    of another devastating world conflict. In this thought-provoking piece, Einstein did not shy away from
                    addressing the horrors and senselessness of war. 
                    He highlighted the immense suffering, loss of life, and destruction that warfare brought to humanity.

                    today's world, where the threat of armed conflict persists. "Why War?" is a testament 
                    to Einstein's moral convictions and his commitment to using his influence to advocate for a more peaceful world.
